# Few indices are far above the average

Let `f` be a function with natural numbers as values on a nonempty finite set `Q`.  Division is
avoided: "`f p` is at most `k` times the average of `f`" is written
`f p * |Q| ≤ k * ∑ p' ∈ Q, f p'`.

* Fewer than `|Q|/k` indices are more than `k` times as bad as the average
  (`Finset.mul_card_above_average_lt`, Markov's inequality).
* So for `k` functions there is one index at which each of them is at most `k` times its average
  (`Finset.exists_forall_mul_card_le_mul_sum`, the union bound).
