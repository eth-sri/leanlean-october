# The host of Theorem 17: the parameters and the small case

The first part of the host procedure `et17` (Exact Triangle by Theorem 17) computes `D`, `g` and
`s = ⌊√D⌋` and tests whether `n` is small (`et17Params_spec`).  If it is, the host calls the brute
force (`et17Small_spec`; proof of Theorem 19: "smaller instances are solved by brute force").
