# Theorem 17 as a claim about programs of the light language

`Claim.Theorem_17 M MM D g` says: from every solver of Lop-AE-SparseTri with running time `T` there
is a solver of Exact Triangle whose running time is at most
`4ng (T + C n²/√D) + C (κ n³ log n/g + MM(n) D^{3/2} + n² D g)` (`bound17`, with the three terms
`termScans`, `termPrime`, `termBuild` of the additional time).  Here `κ` is the exponent in
`|w(e)| ≤ n^κ` (the paper's ν), `D` and `g` are the parameters of the reduction as functions of
`n`, `MM(n)` is the number of ring operations of the matrix multiplication, and `M` says what
"solved in time" means.
This file reduces the claim, for the interpretation by programs of the light language, to two facts
about a host: it turns solvers into solvers and keeps their need (word size, cells, depth of calls)
polynomial, and its time function obeys the bound (`ObeysBound17`, `claim17_of_host`).
