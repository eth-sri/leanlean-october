# From a realized running time to a program with the paper's bound

A claim gives a running time `T` with `T ≤ C X`, where `X` is the bound that the paper prints, and
`RealizedWithin` gives a program that takes `c T + c` steps.  This file puts the two together.

* Bounds in several parameters, valid on a domain on which `X ≥ 1`: `exists_solves`, and
  `exists_solves_nonneg` with `exists_solves_pair` for two programs with one slope and one constant.
* Bounds `O(n^a (log n)^e)` in one size, valid for all large `n`: `solvedAt_of_realized`, and for
  every exponent `κ` of the magnitude `solvedInTime_of_claim` and `solvedInPolylogTime_of_claim`.
* An instance with numbers bounded by `n^κ` is also one with numbers bounded by `n^κ'`, `κ ≤ κ'`
  (`solvedInTimeAt_mono`), so that a bound for all `κ ≥ 1` is a bound for all `κ`
  (`solvedInTime_of_one_le`).
